Overall","Everyone Should Use Zoom!
Nov 11, 2016",10.0/10,"Pros: What is not to like? Better quality than the rest and easier to use! They are responsive to feature requests. The Zoom Rooms product is amazing too.
Cons: Not much.
Overall: Seriously, if you do any sort of video or web conferencing...even if it is just to share your screen, Zoom is so much better than any other solution. I've tried them all. And it is often cheaper. I now have about 25 business users and another 50-60 free users. This has by far been the easiest tech rollout in our company in an industry with generally very non-tech people.
Recommendations to other buyers: Get it. You can start free!"

Dec 05, 2016",10.0/10,"Pros: Simple and clean UI

Reliable
Cons: Has to have a taskbar icon instead of just a system tray icon (very nitpicky)
Overall: I started using Zoom about a year ago and it has become my new go-to for web meetings. The UI is simple while still offering much of the same functionality of its competitors. I have also yet to have crashing issues as I have experienced with similar products. I don't really have anything negative to say.
Recommendations to other buyers: Use it."

Overall","Critical for Medium to Large Remote Companies
Oct 03, 2016",8.0/10,"Pros: It makes video calling with large groups super easy, allows for video call record, easy invite with a link to call, scheduling calls. I use the Desktop app most the time, but the mobile app has been very handy for calls on the go. I've never used a video conferencing app that can support so many callers in one session, makes for a pretty magical experience to bring your whole team together from literally across the world.
Cons: Zoom for me does have call stability issues. Overall I have relatively rock solid internet connection, yet it can drop video calls from time to time. The tricky thing is it's hard to know who drops the call. It's a con, but I want to be gracious to Zoom because they essentially perform a miracle every time you make a call with tons of people. I wish they had a better way to downgrade video performance but keep video calls live.
The truth still stands that I'm not sure anyone else is doing what they are capable of, so overall still very pleased despite the occasional hiccup with connection.
Overall: This is video conferencing made available to nearly anyone with it being available on every major platform and supports dial in. If you work with teams of 10 or more and need video conferencing I've found no other service that work better.
We use Zoom at my company for every meeting from 1:1s to All Hands meetings of 90+ people (up to 500 I believe). Overall the product is quite simple and makes Video and VOIP calling easy. It has a great ability to allow you to schedule video calls in the future and share a link to the video. This is super handy for calls within your team or outside.
Recommendations to other buyers: Have fast and consistent internet speeds if you intend to take regular calls. Spotty connections can be a damper on calls."

Oct 04, 2016",NA,"Comments: My employer recently switched from GoTo Meeting to Zoom. The transition was relatively painless. It works on the same principle as GoTo, but with a different layout and locations for the various features. I do like the ability to draw/markup the screen, very handy.

With other services we struggled with finding the right balance between easy to use features (recordings, screen share, etc.) and simplicity. We also like that it doesn't crash on us all the time like others did when we were on the market."

Nov 04, 2016",NA,"Comments: I don't generally like video conferences because I've had so many technical difficulties in the past with the platforms but zoom is the exception to that rule. Zoom has made it so easy for us to do video conferences and I've never had any buffering issues, loss of audio or any other issues I've experienced with other programs."

Overall","Made us more productive
Nov 15, 2016",10.0/10,"Pros: We like its consistent quality connection across a variety of connection speeds, its video capacity, and how user-friendly it is for groups.
Cons: I wish that there were more views of the video feeds, more beyond the two built-in viewing options.
Overall: We moved over to Zoom after using another service for several years and have not looked back. Zoom works very reliably for our virtual team - and we fire it up at least once a day if not several times a day for our team of ten scattered around the country. Now that we've been using it a number of global network groups have shifted over as well, so about three times a week I'll be in on a call with reps on it - with video feeds - from Asia, Africa, Europe, Middle East, India, and Latin America. Here's an underrated service that Zoom allows: Breakout rooms! So anytime we have more than one conversation to hold, we break out easily, assign people to the rooms, and voila! Separate rooms. Great value for price, and a quality product."

Overall","One of the least-crappy conferencing services
Nov 15, 2016",8.0/10,"Pros: Easy to use, easy plugin
Cons: Not great for large group meetings.
Overall: It's amazing how bad video conferencing is given how great data and the internet are in general. But Zoom at least doesn't crash very often and has a relatively easy plugin. I've used Citrix and all the others out there...I think my absolute favorite for ease of use is Uberconference, but it doesn't have as much functionality. Zoom is the right balance if you're doing small group or 1:1 meetings. It's probably not the best for giant webinars or complex screen sharing/drawing (in which case you'll likely need GotoMeeting or one of the other big ones.
Recommendations to other buyers: No

Hi Olivia,
We appreciate your feedback! Zoom typically performs very well for large meetings and webinars, so I would suggest contacting our support team if you are encountering problems (https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/requests/new).

Overall","Hey, can we Zoom real quick?
Nov 21, 2016",NA,"Comments: We used to use Google Hangouts for the longest time, then after being disconnected 123535238427 times, we finally decided to look for another software. Yes, Google Hangouts is free and it shows. A lot. We found Zoom and were offered a 30 day trial. The ability to schedule meetings with the link in the calendar was a huge perk. The only downside is having to install the software, but luckily, it doesn't take too much time. If your computer is running quite a few programs, a white text will pop up on the screen during a video call and let you know your CPU usage is affecting the video quality. Overall, we love Zoom and it's integration with Slack. Becuase we use it ALL the time and frequently use it as a verb."

Overall: Zoom is pretty good at what it does. Some of my coworkers have mentioned sound issues on live webinars, but I primarily use this for group meetings with our remote office. For what we need it to do, it works great - screen sharing, video (when we want it), conference lines, and chat."

Feb 01, 2017",10.0/10,"Comments: Love Zoom! Really simple and easy to use... high quality... good features like recording and screen sharing. Love it.
A few things I would improve: more keyboard control, and keyboard shortcuts, for example when joining a meeting i have to click the little arrow to see recent meeting IDs, why can't I just press down arrow on my keyboard?
Also, ""always use PMI for instant meetings on this computer"" should be checked by default - I thought this was a premium feature and didn't even discover it until recently. So much easier to schedule meetings now. Didn't even know it existed..."

Apr 19, 2017",9.0/10,"Pros: Call quality and ease of use.
Cons: Interface navigation is a bit confusing, specially when switching views / screen sharing, etc. Buttons move arround depending on the view you are at. For corporate users, I dislike having to contact sales person every time we need to add more licenses.
Overall: I use Zoom at a company I provide services to. We use a corporate account and use it for communications between more than 80 employees in several countries and offices. We stopped using Zoom chat, replacing with another solution with better search features (to look for older conversations). But we often use Zoom for conference calls and eventually webinars. The interface is easy to use, even though a bit confusing in the beginning. Could be more intuitive. Call quality is way better than the common old time video call competitor.

User management is not so easy, since you often have to contact a sales representant to get more licenses. Could be all online.
Recommendations to other buyers: Try it out, i's really good."

Overall","Need to screen share? Try Zoom.
Apr 20, 2017",9.0/10,"Pros: * Screen share (great for training purposes)

* Mute all

* Able to disable and enable mute and video easily

* Ability to share a zoom link with whoever needs to join the meeting
Cons: * This is probably just me, but I tend to have a headache after using Zoom, which probably has more to do with the audio quality on my end than with Zoom.

* When screen sharing, the menu box gets in the way -- it'd be nice if we could move this to be on the side or somewhere else.
Overall: I've been using Zoom for both larger and smaller meetings, it's great for both. Screen sharing doesn't lag, and being able to share a zoom link with others is so convenient!"

Easy to use and love not having to physically dial in to calls....one click and you are in! Also, great support when you need it. Zoom has worked well for our company and has saved us money in long distance calls.

Cons: There is still a lot that they could do to make it easier for use in a way that helps us help our clients remotely.

Feb 03, 2018",NA,"Pros: The is fantastic for both video conferences and webinar presentation. For the virtual team that usually relies on Skype for video calls, you will have a clearer, safer, and more versatile experience with Zoom. A few of my favorite features include: screen sharing, screen annotating and control (in which you can make comments on the shared screen or take control of the shared screen), and the ""raise hand"" feature which prevents attendees from talking over each other. For webinars, the breakout room feature is also nice because you can divide a large audience into small groups for additional learning, without completely leaving the call.
Cons: Zoom pulls a lot of bandwidth, particularly when sharing screen, so if you are trying to run too many programs at once it will kick you out and restart. This is usually fine for a team call, but can be embarrassing during a client meeting."

Mar 06, 2018",8.0/10,"Pros: So easy to many people in one room, see their faces, and speak to remote coworkers. The chat feature also makes it easy to participate or source for input in larger settings. There is also a poll feature that is useful to make quick decisions, and the host can send folks into smaller rooms within the meeting for quick brainstorming.
Cons: Participants have to download the software to participate, so if you are planning a very large video broadcast, a webinar service would be better. If you are sharing your screen, it's difficult to see every participant or the chat unless you are using multiple screens."

Cons: The only thing that would change this application is that when your Internet is very slow it adapts to it making the image quite bad.

Mar 07, 2018",NA,"Pros: I have been using zoom through a webinar based class that is hosted from an office in California, and there are students from all over the world. The sound and picture is clear, and everyone is able to get on with ease: the admin can mute all the users, which is great, and if everyone's camera is on, the presenter is the main screen you can see which helps from distraction. We have about 25-30 users on the call weekly, and it works great!

Overall","Zoom is the backbone of my coaching practice.
Mar 09, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: I have been using Zoom for a few years now. I love its ease of use and quality. How many times have I been on a Skype call and it froze in the middle???? I avoid Skype at all costs now.

With Zoom I can easily schedule my client meetings. I actually have the invitation already pasted into my appointment confirmation and reminder autoresponder, with the url and dial-in information. It's so easy to manage appointments this way.
The recording feature is helpful as well. When your session is over, the recording is available in different formats, video and audio, and gets automatically processes and stored in your computer and available to upload to my clients.
I like the video conferencing feature for groups as well, with different screen possibilities. I can choose to view everyone at once, only a few people at once, or the speaker. This is helpful for webinars and group coaching.
Share screen is a feature I use in different ways. For client enrollment conversations. I can actually share the Agreement form and go through all of the contract terms in real time, being able to close the sale more quickly. In client sessions I can go through their website or materials and give real-time feedback, which is invaluable.
Chat feature makes workshops, webinars and group sessions engaging and lively. The speaker can read the chat questions and comments and respond.
Cons: I can't find much to compain about. I was using the free feature and was dissapointed that I couldn't have a longer session with more than one person, but I've since upgraded. There is a video tutorial for how to do a background in the upgraded version but I'm finding it a little hard to follow. At one point I thought I had a different version of Zoom than the one they were showing. So that was confusing.
Overall: Gives me an edge over my competitors, credibility, community, communication, engagement. Added value to coaching experience -- recordings are priceless."

.- Very light application for remote session that can be used even with low bandwith internet connections

.- Audio features that enable the user to connect through the PC or Laptop and through phone call

.- Chat and sharing options

.- Can record the session locally or in the cloud.
Cons: As Cons, may be mention:

.- Dismiss the Control Panel when you are sharing your screen

.- Could be nice if over the screen that we are sharing have available control for pointer and market to enforce sections of the material shared

.- Some user refers problem to enable the audio plugins and need to use the phone call option.
Overall: As a consultant services provider, in our company we use Zoom as the first option to handle virtual session rooms for tasks that involve remote interactions with our customer or prospect, related to training, support, sales, demos and coaching activities. Most of the meetings with our customers are managed through this software rather than by phone calls, reducing cost of phones services."

Apr 04, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: Great service and solution for business meetings, presentations or online conferences. Also, Zoom is an excellent tool for hosting audio or video conferences. It is great because you can have a dedicated meeting ID to share with people, it's very easy to launch the conference off desktop or mobile, and it offers to record it easily. It's well suited if you're on a call with more than a single person. Also, it will be suited especially if you're worried about Internet connectivity on either side, because the quality of video and audio communication is always on top, even if the Internet speed is very poor.
Cons: Zoom's price point is higher than other video conferencing tools. There is a free version as well, but of course, it has a limited amount of capabilities, it has limits in terms of the number of participants. The calendar setup is not great as it doesn't directly connect to my Google Calendar, or I just could not do it."

Apr 09, 2018",NA,"Pros: Zoom has a no-frills approach to video conferencing, but its functionality set is still comparable with the likes of GoToMeeting, Blue Jeans, and other popular offerings. The great thing about it, though, is that the niceties are tucked away behind a pretty intuitive and manageable UI, which makes for a pleasant user experience. I really enjoy how easy and quick it is to pull recordings down from the cloud, and the application management interface is very straightforward. The Chrome plugin also makes adding Zoom meetings to Google Calendar invites effortless.
Cons: Sometimes, and often without rhyme or reason, the Mac OSX app will just stop working and will need to be Force Quit and reopened. It's not a huge deal, but because it fails silently, it's one of those things you only really notice when you're trying to actually use the software.

Cons: We use a couple of accounts throughout the company to hold meetings. the only detail I found is that if I schedule the meeting as a technology staff we keep track of the account to better organize the meetings of all, if I, as the account's principal, do not agree and I give control to a person within the meeting, they will not be able to record, because it requires that the person with the host is the one who has the permissions for it. in that aspect they depend on one as the staff that manages the account, the key is not given to everyone so that there may be some organization

May 04, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: Audio and video conferencing are a breeze. Connectivity is simple. In fact, as long as the host has an account and the software, no other participant needs to register for anything. They can join either by following a link on a computer, or calling in via a generated telephone number. The free version of the software allows unlimited conferencing with two participants. The quality is definitely superior to its competitors.
Cons: On a free account, group conference calls are limited in terms of the time allowed to record, so if you're not a paid subscriber, this is something to be mindful of.

Cons: The stream-audio-while-sharing feature exists but it isn't very good yet as audio and video lag and are jumpy. Needing the host to start the meeting is unnecessary. When using multiple monitors, there are not easy options for making the remote attendees the largest picture.

May 06, 2018",9.0/10,"Pros: The speed and quality in the video is the best, since unlike other video calling software, zooming does not stop during streaming or streaming even if the internet bandwidth is not the idea. The communication is very fluid for conferences and webinars.

   Cons: The only limitation for the free license is the 40 minutes to make conferences, but with this time you can try all the functions without problems. The option of being able to record in the cloud is very important to monitor the webinar and other events at a distance.
Overall: One of the most important functions is the ability to remote control, because through zoom I can give technical support or help another user in a video call, this function plus the option of sharing screen or window, is all that is needed to provide remote help, in addition to being an excellent option to webinar and record them."

Cons: I was hoping that Zoom would be a good fit for our entire team to have unlimited audio ability for international calls but this proved to be quite pricey! That's a feature I am hoping we can get soon though!
Overall: Ease of setting up conference calls is the biggest bonus that Zoom has provided for our team.

May 11, 2018",9.0/10,"Pros: We had been using Zoom for client meetings but we had an opportunity to demo our services to a wider audience. We chose Zoom webinar and realized that the first webinar we had to give was going to be with an international audience in France. Luckily, we had some team members that were able to help, but it was helpful to be able to use a tool that would also allow the registrants to register in their native language. Learning how to conduct the webinar only took a bit of time and there were some helpful videos to walk you through the process.
Cons: I think the only challenging part is getting all the participants the right link to connect as a presenter rather than as an audience member (which I think may have been user error). There is a way that you can add the invite to your calendar, which has the audience link included. But when you invite the participants, they are sent a separate link that they need to connect. If they aren't aware that they need to save this link, they click on the audience link and get confused. it happened a couple times and I think that I would like to have a way to send them a calendar invite with a single participant link."

May 16, 2018",9.0/10,"Pros: Offers the ability to connect with people in different areas and countries. Program offers video, chat, screen sharing, personal Zoom rooms, turning options off & on.
Cons: Sometimes toward the end of the video conference, the audio cuts out. Otherwise, I have not had any other challenges.
Overall: Zoom Video Conferencing allows face to face meetings online, even between individuals in different countries. Great to use for one on one or group meetings."

May 18, 2018",6.0/10,"Pros: Zoom is one of the better online meeting tools I've used. I have never used it as a host but have used it to call into others meetings. I like how it is very consistently reliable. I have never had a dropped call or bandwith issues and screen sharing and collaboration is easy to use.
Cons: I really don't have any complaints about Zoom. The one piece that could be improved upon would be the dial in functionality. You aren't allowed to join or enter a meeting room until the host has which can leave everyone waiting. There is also no indicator noise to let others know when someone has joined or left a mtg."

Overall","I can't believe I'm going to say this, but perhaps the best video conferencing solution out there.
May 20, 2018",8.0/10,"Pros: That's right - it's hard to believe anyone would ever give this title to any video conferencing solution, but as I began to write this review I realized it's the only one that hasn't consistently failed me - which is more than I can say for Hangouts, Facetime, Skype, etc.
It's solid. I work at a remote-first company with 800+ employees, and so we use it CONSTANTLY. And it works. nuff said.
Cons: there are some UX tweaks I'd make, and the onboarding for people who have never used it before can be a bit tough. I've sent links to people and then they join the call late and explain they were figuring out how to use Zoom... which is probably inevitable, but there's a need to address that sooner rather than later.
Also, they should update the UI, like the chat functionality is difficult to use sometimes, especially if you're sharing your screen already."

May 21, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: Recording calls, being able to record calls for myself and/or clients in both video and have a separate audio file makes my life so much simpler. No need to have extra things that, just one tool to do it. The quality on the call and the ease of use beats the other apps I've used almost all the time. I've even (with the help of my husband as he's more techy) run a webinar using their webinar system and it worked great, so much simpler than the other systems we've tried. And even when I wasn't paying for the premium version, this was still my fav tool.
Cons: Only that it requires a download, and that the webinar system is pricey. I ended the webinar subscription after the last time when we ran it and will only resubscribe when I'm ready to run it again as it's too pricey to just have it al the time if I'm not running regular webinars."

I never needed to use more than that, so I can't speak on behalf of the Pro plan which I never needed.
Cons: Nothing really; quite straightforward and gives you everything you need in my opinion.

Jun 13, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: After looking for so many programs to use on my laptop, I found Zoom. It has everything I need, a board, efficiently sharing my screen and in good quality, fluent audio, and I can send invite links to my students and friends. The fact that I can record the calls, including the video, without a huge detriment in my RAM, also stands out, because I used to use one program for calling my clients and another one to record them.
avorites:

1. Easy screen recording. You just click the recording button when you start and when the meeting ends, it just takes a little bit to render and then it will be in your folder as an MP4.

2. Private and general chats.

3. Board with every necessary tool to explain anything I need.

4. Performance on my laptop.
Cons: I have no cons.
I still can't think of anything bad to say about this, so, at the moment, I have no cons to speak of."

Jun 14, 2018",9.0/10,"Pros: My work is 100% online and my team is located in different countries, so to be able to meet them efficiently I opted for the videoconferences that Zoom offers me.

I like its interface because it is easy to use, you can share files, share a screen and much more.

The quality of Zoom seems pretty good and you can get a number of people in a room video conferencing together. Has lots of great features most I've never used but cool none the less like changing your background, meeting scheduling, and screen share.

It's fairly simple to use and full of features.
Cons: The meeting scheduling piece is hard to use if you are not using Zoom as the starting point for your meeting. That you have to download and install software is a drag in this day and age but it probably provides for the better video quality.

I love that it allows for communication with each other even if there's over 10 people. The different view options and the private messaging etc. also allows personalisation. I love the ""raised hand"" function because it means during a workshop you can keep people muted and see when they have a question and unmute them.

Jun 21, 2018",7.0/10,"Pros: I like that it is very easy to get up and running with Zoom even without reading any of the tutorials, readme's or getting started videos. The application is great on the Mac OS X, really big buttons make it simple and straightforward to host a web con quickly, with just 5 buttons, less is more definitely more. The settings is easy to get to as its in the top right, contacts and chats is also a click away on the bottom nav bar. It feels pretty effortless to both join and leave calls.
Cons: I don't like that when you join a web con, it some times goes full screen straight away. Now I have never looked into the configuration but that is most def one of the most annoying things about the application. It's also a bit tricky to check what settings are active on a web conference. For me - the 2 things I want to go when joining a meeting of 100+ participants is (a) Turn off my web camera (b) Mute my microphone and honestly it should be easier to do this on the app. Perhaps an incognito mode. But I always get the feeling I am fumbling around to do this when I join a call.
Overall: It is more sophisticated than using Google Hangouts, Join.me or Skype. For hosting web conferences to 100-200 people it does excel in that area. We are using it as our daily driver and we have had mainly positive feedback from our users in the team."

Zoom is relatively easy to use, works well, and the Microsoft Outlook plugin is really useful when scheduling meetings, especially when I have to update the meeting invites multiple times (the Zoom just updates along with the calendar invite). It also has a chat app and ties in with my Outlook calendar, so folks can chat me as well as see when I'm busy/in a meeting.
Cons: My biggest complaint is that, when I want to share my screen, I choose ""desktop"" and then still have to hit the ""Share"" button - even now, I want to just click ""Desktop"" and have that trigger the share. All things told, that's not the worst complaint to have!"

Not only that but being able to share your screen is a bonus just because the options are endless. You have control of everything with a few clicks of a button!
Cons: When Zoom conducts an update of its software, it doesn't provide information to the consumers as to what was actually updated. There's been certain times where an update has occur and the layout (buttons) where changed and moved.

Jun 30, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: Zoom has been a wonderful tool to use for meetings and group chats. I also love the fact that they can be recorded and sent for others to watch the replay. Connection was fine between me and the client(s) unlike Skype where it can lag and even cut off connection. Zoom definitely been a replacement for that and works great!
Cons: Not really a con, but do want to let people know there is a free version. You do have limitations of time and how many on the chat/call. But hey- it's the free version. You can always upgrade."

Overall","Incredible. Extremely easy to use (as a host and as an end user), and works well.
Jul 02, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: Ease of use is its best feature. From the host point of view, it is easy to access all of its features. Setting up a meeting is quick, sending out invites is easy, connecting to the meeting and starting a meeting couldn't be easier. From the end user point of view, this system is great. It doesn't need to be installed on the user's PC by an administrator. We just click the meeting link, the meeting launches in a temporary instance, and we are good to go. There is an app for Android and iOS, but those too are easy to install. It uses whatever camera, microphone, and speakers you've got setup on your device. We use this software as part of our Distance Learning programs. And we've used it with schools, museums, and hospitals. Think kids that are sick and cannot leave the hospital. Or kids from a landlocked state, who haven't seen the ocean. We take them on virtual tours of our Aquarium, and show them the bay and the shipping channel, and it's all LIVE VIDEO and two way communication so we can answer questions and show the kids what they want to see. This software is so easy to use, not just for our staff, but also for educators and hospital staff. It's extremely easy for them to click a link and know the software will work without their having to call their IT staff to install software and test it over and over again. We have not had any problems whatsoever with connecting to Zoom or during our meetings that weren't related to our internet or end user's internet connection.
Cons: I'm hard pressed to pinpoint what I like least about this software. Seriously, it's easy to use, it has a lot of features, and everyone likes it. I would say maybe the cost is probably the worst thing about it. But honestly, it is not even that expensive.
Overall: Biggest benefit is helping us to serve out our mission of education and conservation by letting us reach students who cannot come to us."

Jul 12, 2018",NA,"Pros: My company uses Zoom and their Zoom Room services for our 8 conference rooms. If you work with their team to get this all set up, it can go really well, but there's a lot of set up required to get going. There's some great features like airplaying to share your video, even if you're not connected to that Zoom Room, but in that same location. It makes sharing your screen very easy and convenient. There's lots of great admin features for managing all your rooms, which look great, but I haven't needed to use them too much.
They have great customer support, who is usually very responsive and quick to help out when needed.
Cons: Each Zoom Room requires a controller (usually an iPad or tablet), microphone, webcam, TV or monitor, and a computer all hooked up in order to work. If any of those pieces are missing, the whole room will not work, so it can be very frustrating if something comes unplugged or the iPad dies, you can't do anything till it's all back together.
Some of the admin features are a bit backwards, like trying to upgrade a user on your account. You can't simply upgrade someone, you have to go to your billing page, add an additional person to the list, then go back to that user and upgrade them."

For people who can't afford to step out of the office but still want to be included in important discussions, Zoom is a great alternative to the traditional conference room meetings. I don't use the video function all the time; often just dial in and continue working. Great for screen sharing as well.
Cons: No cons here. Zoom is a really good app and I highly recommend it. It's actually easier to use than many of its well-known competitors."

Jul 13, 2018",NA,"Pros: -This software is very streamlined, and it is easy to find everything I need.

-I like that I am able to share any document on my computer and easily annotate it.

-Zoom can be used on numerous devices, including smartphones and tablets.

-The video and sound quality are great.

-It is easy for participants to enter a meeting: they only need to follow a link and be admitted by the host.
Cons: -Although I can share documents from my computer, I can only do so if they are open (the Zoom file share function does not allow me to select a document to share from my files folder; I can only share documents that are already open).

-Even though I am able to annotate documents that I share through Zoom, if I scroll up or down or change pages, the markings do not move with the page (My annotations remain still, while the document moves). This means I am not able to annotate a page and then return to a page that I previously annotated and have the markings still be intact.

-When saving a screenshot through Zoom, it is difficult to find after the session has ended."

Overall","One of the Best Video Conferencing Softwares
Jul 16, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: The company I owned had 70% of our contract employees in different countries. I was so tired of using Skype because it was unreliable. I had dropped calls, poor audio, and video, with numerous other problems. I started using Zoom for all of our video conferencing needs and have not looked back.
The audio and video quality is excellent. I have not had any problems with dropped calls or low-quality audio. We would normally have 8+ people on the call and it just worked easily for everyone.
Anybody can share their screen to show what they are working on. One of my favorite features is being able to record the session after it was finished. Being able to record is nice for anybody that might have missed the meeting they can go back and watch what they missed.
The app worked great for Android. I do not have an IOS and so I can not speak about the IOS app but I'm sure it works the same.
Cons: It is hard to think of something that I didn't like about the software or something I had problems with. Maybe it would be nice to see a little more customization options during the video conference. Such as you can adjust all of the video windows to any size you want and allow multiple levels of options per the user. This is really not a big deal but it would just be nice."

Allows sharing camera and screen simultaneously.
This is a very lightweight, multiplatform tool that makes conferences really easy. I participated in conferences with users from all over the world, e.g. from UK, Poland, US, Philippines at the same time and there wasn't any latency at all. I believe this is the best collaboration tool, it is very reliable, allows to share a screen and your camera simultaneously. Allows to record meetings in the cloud or locally. I have to stress how seamless it makes the meetings with people literally all over the world. This is a very reliable tool, never crashed on me, always works fast and does not consume a lot of resources.
Cons: Some menus seem a bit convoluted

Sometimes small things can be a bit buried, like disabling enter chime. Also, the HD quality for a camera is disabled by default (probably to save bandwidth).

Overall","Zoom, Zoom, Zoom - For a smooth ride to your next online event
Jul 27, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: Affordable. Reliable. Easy. That's Zoom in a nutshell. We have experienced the heartache of running a webinar only to have the audio cut in and out and glitch the entire time - ultimately causing our attendees to drop off. But, that's not the case with Zoom. Our company, belonging to the industry of software QA and testing, regularly hosts remote meetings to check in and collaborate on progress and future team initiatives. We decided to make the switch from GoToMeeting (a great alternative to Zoom) because it fit our needs more accurately. Zooms customer support is remarkably responsive and very quick to solve any issues encountered. Pros Zoom video conference calling and webinar is fitting for any sized company or organization. Meetings can be scheduled within seconds and added directly from Zoom's platform to Google Calendar, Yahoo Calendar, or Outlook Calendar; which allows you to set up invites and add additional attendees. Zoom provides the option to either enroll in a monthly or an annual plan, in which you can choose to deactivate and/or reactivate at any time (beneficial for saving extra bucks if you do not run regular monthly webinars). The plan that includes 100 participants, for both video conferencing and webinar, are priced at an affordable price per month (GoToWebinar is nearly double in price for the same plan). The audio on calls and webinars comes across crisp; we have never experienced any issues with dropped calls or glitches during webinars). Having the ability to join calls and webinars from any desktop, tablet, and/or phone (iOS and android) is convenient for anyone looking to access meetings on the go. Zoom includes various features, i.e. live screen-sharing, whiteboard, etc., which helps relieve the difficulties of working remotely. If you are holding an international meeting, I.e. training, trainees can join by laptop and listen over laptop speakers (they would have to use laptop and not call in directly via phone to avoid having to pay for extra international call credits - which costs an additional /month). Zoom comes in handy when working with distributed teams; Zoom's conference calling features are great for doing demos, exercises, sprint planning, etc.
Cons: When joining a webinar or a call via mobile device, it's unclear how to join audio (I thought there was something wrong with my phone because it was telling me my audio was on but I could not hear anything during the webinar - turns out I couldn't see the audio number which was hidden behind the webinar). If anyone else has this confusion you can also look at the original webinar confirmation or follow-up reminder and locate the call-in number there. The poll questions and results to not display in the webinar recordings so you will have to edit or takes screenshots and merge them into your recording (we use I movie to do this)."

Cons: If you ever used Zoom for the very first time, you might want to turn off the automatic on of Video and Audio because think about it, if your Prospect isn't ready just yet and you've started your call like 5-minutes early, that will be awkward, right?

Aug 01, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: Great Meeting Room if you have teams. I also do facebook live video shares and how to's . This is perfect for that bc the viewers can see my face in the bottom right hand corner while my screen is also sharing at the same time. Looks fresh and professional.
Cons: I don't like that it's only free for 40 minutes... It should be free the first hour. When you do question and answers on the free 40 minutes you are often times cut off right in the middle. I think you'll get more bang for your buck with the hour.

Aug 01, 2018",9.0/10,"Pros: I most like of Zoom is its high quality video and sound. I always meet under Zoom, because Zoom allows one to share documents on line, even I can manage any software of other person, if he/she allow me, from my computer.
I always use Zoom for teaching my university courses, when my students have to ask me some questions about the course.
When someone needs to meet with me, I always say to him/her, let's meet by using Zoom.
Cons: I least like of Zoom is that, at least for me, I have been very difficult to keep a contact list in my Zoom account. However, I prefer Zoom than other software for communicating me with someone.

Aug 01, 2018",7.0/10,"Pros: I have been using this to communicate via Video Calls or Voice Meetings in my Organisation which is considerable improvement over the previous tool

1. Simplicity - very simple to use, No need to introduce about the features and usage it is almost self explanatory. easy to join a call.

2. connectivity - is excellent, experience less drops, less lags and Clear voice quality

3. Interface - the interface is easy to understand ,clean, intuitive

4. Features - all features are easily accessible and has all features like live screen sharing, Recording, Webinar

5. We also can get the recording of video in Audio format

6. Reminders - reminds about the upcoming meetings and gets integrated easily to google calendar/Outlook and other tools

7. Notifies when a user has joined a conversation
Cons: Zoom also disappoints on the below

1. Call gets disconnected after every 45 minutes. And the setting to set the call timings is a thing which we have to search for

2. When in Group chat if most users leave their Laptop Microphone ""ON"" then their voice echoes after they speak, which makes it annoying, we have to check and turnoff microphone for all except the one who is communicating.

3. Slight lag if 20+ People are communicating
Overall: - Used to train resources from another cities

- communicated with people to solve issues

- conducted meetings

Aug 07, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: It is great in terms of reliability, UI/UX design, quality of video conferencing, and screen sharing.

I am a Technical Analyst and frequently need to interact with my team. It needs many users and managing them is really hard. But with Zoom, I can easily engage with any particular team member rather than all the members. Its screen sharing feature is incredible. With the annotations in screen sharing, I would able to communicate in a much better way.
Moreover, the User interface while video conferencing and screen sharing is interactive and I am sure, not even a new user would be confused while working on zoom.
Cons: Well, I don't have any specific complaints about Zoom but If zoom improves their chat feature a bit more like a sender would know that whether the receiver has read that message or not. because many a time, when we are in an official meeting, I need to send a message to a particular team member and I would never know that whether it was read by them or not.

Setting the meeting is quicker and easier than webex meeting center and it works on different desktop platforms as well as android phone.

Aug 13, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: Screen sharing in live time, ability to easily record video/audio screen sessions and share mp4 video after the end of the session with ease. Free version is very valuable, but I'm getting so much use out of the software that I would pay for the features offered in the free version currently!
Cons: There is a learning curve for ease of setting up meetings but that could be my issue as I'm new to platforms like this. However, there are many options, email text etc to send invites and I appreciate the ability to use on computer or tablet.
Overall: I work remotely in a different state from my business partner so the ability to share entire computer screen or a specific window with ease in live time with my partner has been invaluable. Have also used for live trainings and onboarding with another software. We can both present to each other, making questions and pricrssses much easier with visualization of the steps. Have used whiteboard for my math tutoring clients as well. Overall I have been raving about my experience with Zoom. The more comfortable I get with the features, I would definitely upgrade to paid version as will be using more frequently however free version is quite versatile and extensive."

Overall","Powerful conferencing system with a disappointing commercial model
Aug 14, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: It's been the most reliable platform we've found for video conferencing, anyone is easily capable of setting up a meeting, hosting it or participate actively on it. We've had no compatibility related issues (headseats, operating systems, web browsers, mobile devices). It requires less bandwidth than other products and somehow manages to keep working on some unreliable networks where we had problems with other products like skype and Webex.

It provides a great experience from mobile devices even using mobile data plans (most times, depending on which mobile service provider is used).
Cons: Since we wanted to use a branded URL for accessing, we were forced to upgrade from Pro to Business even when our usage doesn't require the 10 conference hosts that are the entry quantity for Business. We would have paid an additional ammount for the custom URL but such an option is not available. So we are paying for a lot bunch of features we don't need. Anyway, the value we get justifies the price even when we are basically paying twice for every conference host than before.
Overall: I don't intend to try another service for our video conferencing. It'd take some major change on the service we get for us to consider moving to something else. We are looking for different ways to get value from the features we are currently not using, but the price is not too high for this to be a priority.

Reliable, affordable and secure, we need no more."

This software possesses great aesthetics and is very user-friendly. It has helped me connect with many clients located miles away and even in different countries. The record feature is extremely helpful that I can send high-quality videos to my clients just after the session. It is extremely cost-effective.

The application provides tons of tutorials and training sessions to make you comfortable with the system.

Cons: I wish there was a way to generate a report of meeting attendees across multiple meetings, I miss the ability to define your own ad hoc repeating schedule for webinars (allowing you to create one event offered 3 specific times, rather than 3 separate events). Right now you can only define a recurrence on a regular schedule (daily/weekly) or no recurrence at all. Simultaneous video/voip connection seems to be a challenge for less powerful wifi connections.
Overall: We've recently switched from GTM to Zoom after several years. As the account admin, I found the sales process to be thorough and helpful. Training coworkers has been a breeze, and Zoom also offers complimentary training they can use. The user experience for our meeting guests/clients has been very smooth, except for the occasional bandwidth hiccup for someone using video/voip and a less powerful wifi connection.

Cons: Because of its multiple functions, it was difficult to learn--particularly in the middle of a presentation or meeting.

Aug 21, 2018",8.0/10,"Pros: Since I am mostly in China, I appreciate that I don't have to use VPN to use this product. Better yet, the phone integration works right out of the box and is easy to have Zoom dial my local cell number. WebEx had this option too but it did not integrate as seamlessly. Once I got used to the zoom UI, I had no problems moving on from WebEx. Zoom handles lag on the audio very well. The mobile app also works quite well.
Cons: Sometimes I would join when the host wasn't present and the meeting would not open ... however this is a setting that can be configured. I don't like the fact that the host has to be present before zoom can dial your phone ... however I get this is probably for security reasons.

Aug 21, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: What i love about Zoom is that it is so easy to connect the digital team from multiple cities, sydney, melbourne and manila, in a simple click of the button. Being able to schedule meetings, send out invitation codes and easily coordinate digital team meetings helps make the team run a smooth sailing ship.
One thing we love about this software is that it allows us to share screens with each other. When a team member is having a problem, a quick zoom call, screen share, and the problem is fixed. Integrating with a mobile and ipad app helps so much as you dont need to be on your computer to assist the team, or to attend a meeting.
Cons: The only things that i think are holding back the software is that it consumes a lot of power when using it on a lap top or mobile device, its expected but make sure a charger is handy. I think it would be great if you have some controls over the picture. Sometimes i want to make my image brighter and it would be amazing if it can integrate that in the future.

Overall","Flawed User Interface
Sep 04, 2018",4.0/10,"Pros: When I used this for a conference call (which was setup by the consultant for my organization I was ""meeting"" with), I appreciated the fact that in theory it makes connecting easier, allows for multiple forms of interaction (video, phone, etc.), and protects user's personal contact information by allowing for dialogue through the platform's phone number and/or app.
Cons: I struggled to connect with my conversation partner multiple times and with both the video and phone feature. Both mediums didn't accept the meeting number that I was given to type in as an access code, and on the phone line, the automated voice back kept adding numbers I didn't type in when repeating the access code I was trying to use back to me. And, after two failed attempts, the system just ended the call, without offering to connect me to customer service. I finally go through to my meeting, but this was very underwhelming.
Overall: I think adding options for engaging with immediate customer service when the platform is being used would be critical here, especially if you're on a tight timeline for your meeting."

Users can share their screens if they wish to present as well as participate in the chat for conversations on the presentations. You are able to schedule regular meetings on our calendars with a link directly to those meetings.
Cons: I personally do not like to zoom to use my computer camera to show my image in the meeting. It is very easy to turn this off, however, this is the default setting and can catch you off guard if you are unaware. Sometimes zoom remembers the next time I go in to turn this off automatically and sometimes I have to do it manually.

Once in a Zoom meeting, all of the controls are easy to both find and use, no more waiting 5 minutes to figure out how to change presenter.
And then there's Zoom Rooms, a must-have investment for any SME>Enterprise conducting 5 or more web conference meetings per week. Zoom Rooms allow for a super professional experience and are simply awesome.
If you're using GoToMeeting (or any other web conferencing tool for that matter) get a Zoom trial today, you won't be disappointed!

Overall","I've used this software since 2015
Sep 12, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: Zoom is a software that I can't and I wouldn't get away from. I love that is so easy to set up and use. I've used it for school, work, and on ocassions I've used it for personal use to video chat with my family. For school, you are able to breakout students into groups, you have an area designated for questions, the ""raise hand"" feature if students have questions, and you can even give small pop quizzes. At work, I've been able to talk to clients that are across the country, share work with screen share, there's a waiting area just in case you need it, and there's so many programs you can integrate with zoom as well. Another great thing about zoom, is that there is a free subscription option, which has a few limits, but it works great. If you're a paid user you get the perks of personalizing your conference room or hosting a larger group. Unlike other services where you get a trial period and you can't really use it after that unless you pay for it, zoom will always be free, of course with some limitations.
Cons: The free subscription will only allow you to host a 40 minute meeting, so you have to make it quick. Another con is the fact that you can't really mute call notifications unless you mute the sound on your computer, and the bubble notifications when you're in a meeting just keep showing, which can be annoying when you're in a lecture and there's something on the screen in that area.
Overall: Overall, I love this software. It is the best thing that's happened to me. I was able to go to school and finish because of zoom and it is the reason I was able to learn new skills for new career."

Takes a little bit to get into a meeting
Overall: We have used Zoom almost exclusively at my University for the past couple years primarily due to the ease of use but the cost is also a benefit since the basic program is open source. It is easy to set up a meeting, though if you don't have the link to the system on the computer you're going to use it can be a bit confusing to set it up. And that includes accepting a meeting invite. The video tool is good as long as your camera is of decent web-quality as is the audio. It does give you the opportunity to test your audio/visual when you log in which helps if you question your equipment.
This is a program that I would highly recommend for anyone needing a lost-cost video conferencing tool for two (2) or more individuals."

Cons: The only thing I don't like is that it makes you download software to use it, so the first time there is a bit of a delay before you can use it.

Sep 12, 2018",9.0/10,"Pros: What I like most about Zoom is its flexibility. Imagine before you will need to visit a room just to do a conference and visit different places. But with zoom it makes the conference with ease because you can already do it in the comfort of your office, while in commute, in your home, or while in a coffee shop.
Also, Zoom lets you do a conference with your team globally.
Cons: The least that I like about the software is that if you are in a place with weak signal you wont be able to access the app. But almost anywhere now there's a lot of strong signal so it wont be a problem.

Sep 13, 2018",9.0/10,"Pros: I was recently introduced to the product, here's what I like the best:

1. Free version allows up to 50 minutes of video conferencing, with a ticker to let you know the time left

2. Multiple views that allow one to choose from.

3. The speaker gets highlighted and given maximum screen space(useful when there are multiple participants)

4. Allows private messaging( or group thread)

5. Just have to provide the client with the Meeting ID and you're all set
Cons: 1. More work needs to be done for stabilising the connection in areas of slow network

2. Although I've given permission for the contacts import( and there are people who are on Zoom), it still shows no contact in the Contacts tab( iPhone)

Sep 18, 2018",9.0/10,"Pros: I've been using Zoom to host our team meetings with my VA agency client. Their free version is so amazing that you usually can't find in well known platforms like Go To Meeting. Their features are at par with their competitors. You can share your screen to the meeting attendees and you can control the mic of the attendees to manage the meeting.

Sep 18, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: The clear, crisp looking visuals. The clear audio. The ease of use, not just for me as the organizer, but for all of the attendees as well. Zoom seems to have ironed out some of the issues that plague their competition (like Skype). I have never had one instance where trouble occurred during one of my calls. Not one! You can sign up for the free account and test it yourself before committing to a budget for using Zoom. But even on the paid accounts - the services are the BEST!
Cons: I had a couple of people have issues when trying to access the call via a mobile device. I myself have never tried to run a call using my cell phone, so I cannot attest to whether or not that is a running issue or was just a ""one off"" experience.
Overall: Zoom Video Webinar has taken us from using Skype on split screen, hoping and praying nothing goes wrong, to having complete confidence in Zoom to deliver quality every time. Quality is what we try to use to influence our clients - and Zoom delivers!"

You can schedule meetings and the application notifies you.

Overall","Fantastic way to run a webinar, easy for everyone involved
Oct 10, 2018",9.0/10,"Pros: I loved the ease of use when it came to running webinars. We utilized this feature to run webinars for up to 100 people at a time, and we had no issues with people registering or downloading the software. The connection was almost always good, and there were great features like chat and Q&A that were easy to use as well. We didn't use the features that included registering through Zoom, we had our own landing pages to register, but it's nice to be able to have that feature available. I also appreciated the analytics reports that came with the webinar.
Cons: The analytics reports weren't exactly the most user friendly, they just came in excel sheets. It would be nice to have a more well designed report that was easy to share. Other than that I had no real issues with it, I found it to be easy to use for hosts and attendees!"

Sending links to the meetings gets everyone on board quickly. It also integrates with Slack and Google Calendar which have been HUGE for our organization. The share screen ability also helps a lot!

Oct 10, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: See above title. Zoom took a stale industry and revitalized it. Want to share your screen on audio or video conference with someone an ocean and continent away? Want it to be for free? Want it to not crash at unpredictable, important and multiple times? Want to not share your screen but simply treat this conferencing communication like an international phone call? Then Zoom Video Conferencing is your answer to any and all of the above questions.
Cons: I wish I had heard about Zoom many years before I had heard about it. It would have made business communication much more frequent and simple to use.
Overall: So far, I have yet to deal with customer service because I have not had the need to reach out to customer support on any issues. I am also a frequent user with high standards of what I expect a technology company to deliver their loyal customers. Zoom, if you are reading this, keep up the innovation and reliable communication that consistently delivers quality sound and video performance unmatched by competitors I've tried."

Oct 12, 2018",9.0/10,"Pros: Since I often conduct training and consultation sessions with new hires, fellow workers, and clients, I explore various conferencing software that have the best performance. Zoom Video Conferencing is one of them. Designed to encourage interaction, Zoom is best for interactive training. This can be used both for one-on-one and group sessions. Each session can have as much as 500 to 1000 attendees! What I like best about Zoom are its screen sharing and call recording features. I also like the whiteboard feature, which can be easily saved for future reference. Its mobile app is great, too, so I can my sessions on mobile.
Cons: Zoom, however, is not ideal for large audiences or for marketing. It would be better if Zoom adds a function that enables easy file-sharing among participants. I hope there's also a way to automate chat-saving. All in all, I like Zoom. It's a good alternative to Skype and other conferencing software."

Oct 18, 2018",8.0/10,"Pros: I'll admit, I only used this for the first time yesterday. But I'm highly pleased with my experience and here to spread the word! Here are the pros from my experience:

- So easy to set-up. Within 2 minutes, my presentation and video webinar was set up and ready to go. No hassle, no stress.

- There's opportunity for the ""audience"" - I'm not sure if that's what you'd call them - to raise their hand, chat, and interact with the presenter. They can ask questions and easily obtain help.

- You can easily screen share, or show your screen to the individuals you are presenting to or collaborating with.

- There's a free option to start with - it's a great way to introduce yourself to the platform before jumping it in. From what I can tell, it offers a lot of the same great features - a great taste or introduction.
Cons: Due to my limited experiences, I do not have any cons at this point. I cannot speak to customer service or user experience. I do not know much about the experience of the ""audience,"" although all seemed positive. I would note that the bubbles popping up were somewhat annoying. A simple position change may be helpful, but it's not necessary. It is good to receive the notification so that you're aware
Overall: Big fan so far. This seems like it has a lot of potential going forward. It's much more robust than other programs I've tried to use, and the screen sharing feature is awesome."

Sometimes everyone shows up on video, sometimes most are phone only, and I had one group that did nearly everything on the chat even though a couple of them were on video. Most of my students find it simple to share their screens too, which is the best kind of learning and presenting experience. As a teacher and podcaster, I really like being able to record on separate audio tracks. But the BEST bit is that there are international phone numbers so my international students can call in if they need to.

Cons: I haven't used Zoom Video Conferencing enough YET to say, if I had to say something, it's that I had trouble find the Leave Meeting button at the bottom right, but that's a one time issue and was the only least thing I liked so far. I have not yet schedule a meeting using Zoom, only attended, so I cannot speak to the Host scheduling part of it.
Overall: I had my first video conferencing using Zoom today & it was unbelievable! The UI has large icons/buttons that made it easy for me to quickly know where to click to mute myself, start my video, open the chat window and so much more. I loved how when the host shared the screen, all the participant windows shrunk to the side but we were still able to clearly see other without buffering or lag time. It was extremely seamless as the host moved from her video cam, to sharing her computer screen and then another attendee wanted to share her screen and just like that, without any delay, buffering, fumbling around trying to find what to click - her screen showed, again, no lag time or lost connection! This is now my favorite video conferencing tool! And I've used almost all of them, but this one is innovative and allowed for a productive meeting, while others I've used seem to have declined in usability over the years and too much time is wasted trying to resolve connection issues. Zoom Video Conferencing video and audio quality was excellent, multiple audio options (call out, call me, computer audio), similar to the competitors. It's an all thumbs up from me for Zoom Video conferencing! I actually am looking forward to our next virtual meeting!"

Oct 25, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: Zoom is an excellent tool for meetings. It is easy to log in and doesn't require any technical knowledge to have it setup. Zoom allows recording and also let's the other people know that the call is being recorded. The 'sharing screens' feature allows anyone in the meeting to share their screen to rest of the participants thus helping us do demos efficiently. The host having the ability to mute the participants when required also saves the hassle of unnecessary sound distractions from participants' environments. Every host has a permanent link which can be saved by the participants and used for meetings at any given time. The free version allows up to 40 minutes which is ample time to conduct quick and important meetings.
Cons: There is nothing I don't like about Zoom. Absolutely the best of all the conferencing tools I have used.
Overall: I have been using for almost 2 years. This has been by far the most convenient conferencing tool for me and everyone in my team. I have not only used Zoom to conduct meetings but also to record video tutorials that I can share with the team. When we have client meetings the sharing screen option helps me greatly in showing them the insights and more information without actually having them to login to my system. The ability to record has saved us the trouble of repeating the meeting for a missed participant, or pester a colleague to update us on the missed meeting."

Oct 29, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: I work locally and love my face to face time-part of my job is interviewing clients and really watching their faces and body language to see if it verifies what they're saying. So naturally, I was concerned about conducting business on the other side of the nation, but wanted to give video conferencing as a shot to see if I could expand my business to other states. My sister (a software tester) and I tested out Zoom, Google Hangouts, and Skype to see which performed best. Zoom won in a landslide for a clear picture, clear sound, and fast processing.
Cons: We had some issues getting everyone online-the meeting codes didn't always work and at one point, I just had to give up and call in via cell. Major bummer! Also, it's expensive-Skype and Google Hangouts can do the same thing, but for free. Granted, the quality is not good, but Zoom's pricing doesn't quite justify the upgrade until this other glitch is fixed. If I frequently worked with out of town clients, I'd sign up for sure! And if it wasn't so expensive, I might conduct a few in-town meetings over Zoom just to save the trip. As it is, I only use it when nothing else will do."

Oct 29, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: This software is so great for small businesses!! It is cost-effective for a small business budget and presents your company in a professional and tech-savvy manor to clients and perspective clients. Very easy to customize invitations to join a call and supplies attendees with lots of options on how to join a call (video with audio, just audio, just video, etc.). Plus, you can record the video to save for later if there is someone who is unable to join. This feature is PRICELESS for us! Attendees can also join from a desktop, laptop, or smart phone!
Cons: Truthfully, there's nothing about this software that I don't like. When our attendees have been part of the Baby Boomer generation, they will sometimes have difficulty joining the video portion with audio on, especially when they're trying to join via an app on a smart phone. We've tried to make step-by-step instructions that are simple to follow - sometimes that helps and sometimes it doesn't.

Nov 01, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: Zoom is a fantastic tool for virtual group and one-on-one meetings. You can participate in the video conferencing with a mobile device or computer, or you can simply use your phone to call in like you would for a conference call. You can invite up to 100 people to a meeting, so it is used for webinars at the college where I work. You can also send instant messages as well as text files, images, and audio files.
Cons: I don't have any complaints about this software.
Overall: My first experience with the software was when I was invited to a Zoom meeting to be interviewed for an internship. During the internship, my job was to meet weekly with students, and if they weren't able to meet on campus, we could use Zoom as an alternative way to meet. I definitely recommend using Zoom if you're looking for a way to have meetings without requiring everyone to physically be in the same place at the same time. It's also a good way to interview potential job or internship candidates if you wish to use it for that purpose."

Overall: Someone that I network with, referred me to Zoom. I enjoyed chatting and seeing the other person."

Overall","Powerful Tool Once You're In a Conference
Nov 13, 2018",9.0/10,"Pros: Zoom has a lot of underutilized features, like break out rooms and whiteboarding. I love the cloud recording option. Other fun fact: you can host a Zoom meeting with yourself and use it as a screen recording tool for creating training videos.
Cons: Setting up a Zoom can be confusing at times. I also don't know if you can have concurrently scheduled Zoom meetings (I set up Zoom calls for my department and even though different people are in them, since they're scheduled through my account, Zoom throws an error message.) There might be a way, but if there is, it isn't intuitive. Additionally, some of our customers haven't been able to get Zoom to run for them. Not sure if it's user error or what, but it's not good when that happens. Last, our company turned off the ""call me"" audio connection feature because it was too expensive. I miss the feature, but it sounds like they were charging FAR too much for it.
Overall: Basic conference calling functionality when more than 2 people need to be on a call. Also, international calling."

I had a perfectly smooth experience.
Cons: Competing with more aggressive or well-known brands, the biggest hurdle Zoom has is its limited userbase. Aside from that one client, I know no one who uses it yet so I've not have reason to switch to using Zoom for all my video meeting yet."

Overall","Zoom has been a great tool
Nov 17, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: I use Zoom multiple times a day as a student in an online school. It's the first video-conferencing tool I've used, and although I'm fairly tech-savvy, I would have expected there to be at least some learning curve in its use. Instead, Zoom fit seamlessly into my coursework -- all I needed to do was download it and click on a link to my classroom. All of its features - screenshares, chat, remote control, etc - are obvious and intuitive, even for a first-time user.
Cons: My computer is almost ten years old, and if I'm doing a screen share and have video enabled at the same time, its perfomance slows pretty dramatically. Still, that's a tiny issue due to the age of my machine."

Overall","The next generation of video conferencing
Nov 19, 2018",6.0/10,"Pros: Zoom is packed with features, but it can also be used for free for short conversations of 40 minutes or less.
The only person who has to have a zoom account is the organiser. Everyone else gets an invite from the organiser with a link to download a small piece of software to connect them to the video call.
No user id or login needed, so perfect for video conferencing infrequent contacts, such as customers or suppliers.
Super easy to use.
Cons: Not much to complain about, really. There seems to be an ever-increasing portfolio of products to choose from within the Zoom ecosystem.
Overall: We wanted an alternative to a popular video call software which required everyone to have a user id. Zoom took away the need for everyone to have their own user id. However, it retained the features we did like:

- multiparty video call

- screen sharing

- simple to use interface

- some calls can be done free of charge"

Overall","Intuitive, fun to use video conferencing tool
Nov 19, 2018",10.0/10,"Pros: It is a tool that doesn't have to stay in a browser, and you can reliably call in via audio on your phone, web browser, or the app on your phone. You can also have Zoom call you directly on your phone. There are various ways to view other participants, and the chat feature is super intuitive. The settings are very advanced so that you can customize it exactly how it works best for you.
Cons: The only con (which is the same con with any video conference that relies on wifi) is that when you're using it via computer/web browser and are on wifi, the quality of the call will depend on how strong your wifi is. But they have great ways to get around that (calling in via phone too).
Overall: I'm in a sales role, and I really like that I can schedule different video meetings and customize each meeting for what I need. The meeting can be exported into my calendar, and I can go to my account page online to see a list of upcoming meetings and calls."
